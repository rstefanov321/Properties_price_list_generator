# Properties_price_list_generator
A program automating the data transfer from a website to an Excel spreadsheet.

The idea of the program is to get all the offers for properties for rent in a chosen area with a set max rent price and set number of rooms. It is visible in the link in the file. Those parameters can be changed on the website and the new results link can be used in the script as easily. Just make sure the class names match. 

Once the results are in, the code uses a link of a Google Forms page, where each entry is inserted automatically. My google form used 3 details for each offer:
- address
- price per month
- link to the offer page

Once done, you can click on Link to Sheets and create your own Excel table not needing to type in all the data yourself.
